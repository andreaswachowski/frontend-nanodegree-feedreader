# Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to get familiar with the testing framework
Jasmine and implement a few tests for a basic feedreader.

In addition to the required tests, I implemented:
* MockFeedLoader, a mock for the Google feed API which can be used for all
  presentation-only tests (hence tests run faster, and offline execution
  becomes possible)

# Resources
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)
* [Original project](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) (from which this one is forked).
